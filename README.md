# Samba-Gluster Integration Test Environment

The purpose of this project is to provide a generic mechanism to set up a
gluster-ctdb-samba cluster as a test environment. The mechanism is built on
vagrant-libvirt and ansible, and should be able to run on any host that has
support for these pieces of software. It is pulling the latest nightly RPM
builds from the upstream master branches of Gluster and Samba for setting
up the cluster.

In the future, we might support options for choosing to consume pre-built RPMS
or building from a given software branch.

Various branches and resources are playing together to enable this CI:

- [Centos-CI](https://ci.centos.org/) - these are the resource where our tests and builds run.
- [master branch](https://github.com/gluster/samba-integration/) - this brings up the test environment and then the tests from the tests branch
- [tests branch](https://github.com/gluster/samba-integration/tree/tests) - the actual test suites to run, invoked by `make test` in the master branch after environment setup (could be a different repo, but we started here for simplicity)
- [centos-ci branch](https://github.com/gluster/samba-integration/tree/centos-ci) - this contains the script that is run as part of the centos-ci job to prepare the host and trigger our `make test` at the end
- [samba-build branch](https://github.com/gluster/samba-integration/tree/samba-build) - this contains the specfile and ansible automation to build our nightly samba RPMs
- [Gluster Centos-CI jobs](https://github.com/gluster/centosci) - gluster's centos-ci integration: this contains the centos-ci job definitions for all gluster projects that have one, specifically for the samba-integration, nightly samba builds and nightly gluster builds
- [nightly samba rpms repository](http://artifacts.ci.centos.org/gluster/nightly-samba/) - created by the nightly samba rpm build jobs
- [nightly gluster rpms repository](http://artifacts.ci.centos.org/gluster/nightly/) - created by nightly gluster rpm build jobs
